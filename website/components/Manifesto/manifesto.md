The *FlipDotCommunicator* is a device for ~~social distancing~~ [distant socializing](https://zirkus-zirkus.com/products/not-alone-bandana).

In these times of high paced, direct digital communication, it is a reminder of the physical and the momentariness. It is a tool to embrace non-explicit communication.

With its soft and erratic flipping sounds, it should bring a little bit of humanness back to our living space. Every message that is received is deleted immediately from the server. When pressing the button, the content is displayed. Once the button is pressed again, the transmission is gone forever. It can stay forever, but thereby it hinders new messages from being received.

It exists in this moment and this moment onlyâ€”one message at a time. It forces the user to acknowledge the evanescence of a moment, pushing to cherish them more again.
